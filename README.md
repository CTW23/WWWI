When Britain entered World War I on 4 August 1914, no one could have predicted the profound effect it would have on the lives of women.  It was the first war to happen which would affect and involve the whole population.   Pre-war, women received little education, started working in gender appropriate roles when they were young, had no right to vote, never travelled far from home , and the patriarchal society in which they lived had strict expectations of them. By the end of the war in 1918, women had different expectations, different attitudes, and behaviours, different appearances, more confidence and a stronger desire for independence.  Life had changed in terms of work, home life, health and even politically.  In historiography the question has been as to whether it caused long term significant changes for women as a gender group, or whether the opportunities provided were short term and temporary, but it would appear to be a mixture of both.

One of the most significant changes for women during the war was around employment and pay.  Prior to the war, the role of a woman was traditional and narrowly defined ; women who did work, were expected to take on jobs appropriate to their gender, such as domestic service or in the textile industry . They had no access to the jobs which were deemed to be unsuitable by the patriarchal society in which they lived, prohibited by convention .  In addition, married women were expected to stay at home as housewives and care for their family, with the man seen as head of the house .  Things looked bleak for women workers at the beginning of the war; within a month unemployment levels for women had risen by 14 per cent .  According to one estimate in September 1914, 44.4 per cent of all working women were unemployed .  Despite the war it was expected that women would continue to do ‘womanly things’ and not disrupt the war , with their main use being to persuade their men to volunteer .  Even at the beginning in 1915 when men had been called to recruit and labour shortages began, women were not initially considered . In August 1915, the National Register was set up to deal with the increasing demand of the war economy, recording the age and occupation of all men and women between 16 and 65 .  The government needed women to fill the gaps, and between July 1914 and July 1918, 1.25 million more women were employed; 99 per cent of these were covering men’s jobs whilst they were away at war . Women were then employed in jobs that were previously inaccessible to them from post women, to drivers, carpenters to bus conductors  and more. In addition, many women took up dangerous but important jobs, working long hours in munitions factories which was one of the best paid positions .  Furthermore, to enable more men to go into combat, female services were established including the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps in 1917, followed by the WRNS in the navy and the WRAFS in the air force , although there was strong debate about these when first suggested.  Additionally, this enabled some women to work overseas at the Front as nurses and ambulance drivers .  There were concerns at the time as to whether married women with children should work; the debate being that the belief at the time was that women who were pregnant or with young children should not work . The Ministry of Munitions, after much debate, agreed to provide day nurseries , and underwrote 50 per cent of the cost to enable mothers to work , although places were limited. Furthermore, many munitions’ factories introduced industrial canteens during the war, providing their workers with a hot meal each day.  In 1916, there were 45 canteens; by the end of the war there were over 900 . Despite these positive changes and the fact that many of these women enjoyed their jobs, worked hard, and could do the work as well as, or better than, the men , they were paid much less.  Although it was eventually agreed that they would get paid the same as men on piece rates, this was not the same for time rates, of which women were paid between 50 and 66 percent of the male rate.  It was also inevitable that they would lose their jobs once the war had ended, with many unions having worked with employers and the government to ensure men’s roles were protected for their return from war .  Furthermore, they were often underestimated, regarded with suspicion by men and exploited by employers , with some companies implementing pay cuts during air raids, which was not applicable to men .  In Hull, Transport workers unsuccessfully tried to refuse to work with women, and in Liverpool male dockers successfully blocked the employment of women throughout the whole war ; these are just a sample of the resistance that was met.  It was only when the government stepped in that things started to change . Furthermore, many women decided to join trade unions, although many unions banned women.

In addition to work, there were changes to the home and family lives of women.  For the working-class there was a slight improvement in living standards .  Historian Adrian Gregory explains that in Salford, the war caused the single biggest leap forward in living standards, with people having money, women appearing better dressed and houses taking newspapers .  Although early in the war food prices were rising, as was rent and other basics, Historian J. M. Winter suggests that families were able to balance their money to maintain their food consumption, and at times even improve it .  In June 1916, the price of food was 61 per cent higher than two years previous, but wages had only increased by 20 per cent .  At this time, women found their voice and fought against eviction notices ; with their husband’s being away they were solely in charge of ensuring their family were safe and had a home.  In addition, because of the rising prices, public kitchens were set up to combat problems of nutrition and poverty in some areas and campaigns took place for free school meals .

In terms of health, the war improved survival chances in the civilian population . The infant mortality rate decreased over the war years by around ten per cent , although this was higher and lower in parts of Britain.  This could be due to the decrease in birth rates, or that there was less intervention by doctors, however it is strongly suggested by numerous historians that the most likely explanation is the improved nutrition of mothers and their children .  Additionally, this is reflected in the decrease in the mortality of women between 1912 and 1918 .  In 1915 the Mothers and Children Act encouraged better care of women and children ; Furthermore, in 1918 the Maternal and Child Welfare Act introduced clinics for pregnant women and children .  A further indication that nutrition may have improved can be seen in the death rates due to diarrhoeal disease, which decreased 35 per cent between 1912-14 and 1919-21 . The consumption of sugar, butter, meat, and alcohol declined, and bread and potatoes rose, resulting in a starchier diet, but a maintenance of calories .  The inclusion of canteens in the workplace would have helped with this, as workers were discouraged from bringing their own food, and encouraged to eat from the canteen .

A further positive for unmarried women was the relative freedom they experienced, especially for those who were middle-class .  Furthermore, although women were expected to marry and have children, birth rates declined .  However, this newfound freedom was also policed, with the Voluntary Women Patrols and Women Police Service patrolling to control immoral behaviour.  Laws were put in place to control sexual behaviour in some areas, and alcohol consumption in others, with over 1,000 police volunteers patrolling the streets to ensure women did not ‘drift’ into prostitution .  In addition, women started to change their style and dress differently.  Pre-war women usually had long hair and wore dresses and skirts , but the war resulted in women turning to more comfortable and unrestricted forms of dress .  Trousers and shorter skirts were worn, and hair was cut into stylish bobs .  Attitudes changed with women becoming more confident, with some going out on their own, drinking and smoking in public , and frequenting pubs, although men did not appreciate women in ‘their pubs’ .  These changes would have not only been due to their newfound freedom, but also the stresses of everyday life, working long hours, anxiety about family members, caring for family, and having more access to funds .  However, this behaviour also caused others to blame women for the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, and an increase in children born outside of marriage, despite men being as much to blame; these women were frequently regarded as prostitutes .

Despite more independence, women also had to deal with more pressure.  At the beginning of the war, women had to get used to their husband’s not being at home, and although they were provided with a benefit this came with terms.  Not only were they sometimes managing a job and a homelife, but also losing a husband at war, or having to care for an injured husband on their return, many with psychological trauma .  Women would have to deal with their loved ones being away fighting, managing the daily anxiety, suspense, and despair .  Life for a women would have been extremely stressful .  Despite the work they were able to do, dangerous or not, women were still excluded from military service, and this would have caused some feelings of guilt ; especially when they lost a husband, father, or son.  In return for receiving their benefit, their actions and behaviour was policed; should their behaviour seem inappropriate, such as frequenting pubs too often , there was risk of their benefit being terminated.  Women also faced blame and resentment from other family members.  Winter notes that a wife was blamed for her husband’s death by his parents, after he enlisted following a row; the family never forgave her for his death .  This would have had an impact on her and perhaps her mental health, causing her to feel guilty and possibly blaming herself.  Furthermore, if a wife lost her husband, she would no doubt have financial worries.  After the beginning of the war, war widows faced a precarious financial future, and although they received a pension, these rarely reached average wage levels . Not only would she be devastated at the loss of her husband, but she also had to worry about having enough money to support herself, and any dependent family members.

Finally, consideration is needed on what happened in the lead up to the end of the war, and the aftermath.  Women were treated terribly, despite their significant part in the war effort with many of them losing their jobs.  Those who tried to stay in a ‘man’s job’ after the end of the war was ‘transformed from a hero to selfish bitch’ . Married women were treated even more harshly, with people assuming that they were greedy to want to continue working when they had a man at home to support them .  Women who worked in munitions or engineering were reclassified by their pre-war jobs and therefore became ineligible for the unemployed insurance scheme .  By 1919 there were nearly half a million women on the unemployment list, and it was expected that men would get priority where jobs were available, and women should return to the home .  Understandably this left women bitter, angry, frustrated, and resentful.  In December 1918, women who had worked in dangerous munitions factories were offered a 13 week pay off, which at 2.5 shillings a week was far below the wage they had been receiving .  Furthermore, if women refused to go back to domestic service, which was low paid and hated by many, they were then denied any benefits .  Additionally, if women refused to leave jobs, the government would force them to via the new Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act .  Despite the way they were treated, women wanted to work and the number of women working after the end of the war increased, although these were in new industries where women were accepted .  The war proved that women were more than able to carry out ‘men’s jobs’ and that they should be entitled to a decent wage, the same as men; and because of this many women joined unions, fighting for better conditions and pay .

One benefit of the war ending however, was that some women were finally given the vote .  This had been being fought for prior to the war; women were discontented and wanted to have a say, they wanted to be part of the democracy , and the war taking place accelerated things .  In 1918, women over the age of 30 with certain property qualifications were enfranchised, and all men over 21 were able to vote .  However, enfranchisement of women, in line with men, would not come for a further decade .  In 1919, women fought for equal pay, higher minimum wages, and the ability to work in any trade .  Upper class women were able to get a degree from Oxford for the first time , and the first woman became an ILP councillor in 1919.

Finally, although expected, marriage was much more difficult for women.  After the losses during the war, the 1921 census revealed that there were 1.75 million more women than men . It should also be recognised however, that some women after their experience of independence would have chosen not to marry.  Due to this ‘surplus’, which was identified as early as February 1915, the government looked at solutions such as emigration and further intensive training in domestic services .  The concern was not only because of health of the British people, but also the strength of the empire  with the particular focus on the land girls; those who were seen as less feminine.  With articles describing these women as unfeminine, unmarriageable, unnatural, and potentially harmful to British family life , this must have been extremely hurtful after all the work these women had undertaken for the country.  

In conclusion, the First World War caused profound changes for women, although not all of them were positive.  Despite the hard work of women during the war and the fact that they proved they could do the work as good as men, they were still viewed with suspicion and treated despicably towards the end of the war, having been seen as ‘cheap, easily exploitable labour’ . Women were severely underestimated in their abilities, and after the war should be recognised for the additional pressures they may have been under, such as caring for an injured or psychologically traumatised family member or taking care of the family after losing a husband.  However, women did experience a newfound confidence and independence which, despite the best efforts of the patriarchal society, they continued to strive for after the war.  They were able to access jobs in different industries, eventually got partial votes, and had better health, and decreased mortality, as did their children.  Despite the challenges, the war certainly made a considerable change to the women of the time.
